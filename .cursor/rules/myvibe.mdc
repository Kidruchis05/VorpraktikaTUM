# VorpraktikaTUM Project Context

IMPORTANT:
- This is a student internship review platform for TUM Maschinenwesen
- Tech stack: Plain HTML/CSS/JS + Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Design philosophy: Hacker News style - minimal, fast, text-first
- NO frameworks unless absolutely necessary

## Core Principles:
1. Keep it simple - no over-engineering
2. One feature at a time
3. Test locally before moving on
4. Always maintain the HN aesthetic

## Active Development:
- Currently: Adding reviewer names, then filtering/sorting
- Next: Deploy to Vercel
- Future: Auth, moderation, expand to other programs
