i am a first year mechanical engineering student at tu munich. and the reason i am doing this is because this program, maschinenwesen at tu munich, requires a vorpraktikum to attend.. TUM’s Maschinenwesen B.Sc. still requires an 8‑week “Fertigungs‑Vorpraktikum” and you must show proof before you’re admitted to the bachelor’s thesis. but many, say half, do not have any internship or not in the scope that is required. and i noticed that maybe half of the ones that indeed took their 8 weeks did not enjoy it because it was at a werkstatt. imagine getting out from school wanting to attend the best university in germany and having to schleifen on a metal block for weeks before repetitively working on some drehmaschine to make metal parts for example. with people who have the realschule and hauptschule and ausbildung mindset.

So in practice the majority of places on offer are small metal‑working shops or Ausbildung‑style training centres. The work is mostly manual, low‑pay / unpaid, and students often scramble to find a slot in the narrow August–October window. Numerous forum threads ask the same questions every year, which confirms the information gap

 the work is not intellectual, its manual labour, and after weeks of it you develop a negative attitude. This is not what you want to do. Those that did find places, had to ask a lot of companies, and its very time consuming. its as if people need to reinvent the wheel and look for prakika. The problem is transparency on which companies actually take interns. who come straight outta school. There are numerous platforms, but they require experience. some projects, some side hustle, some coding, some mechanics modeling, and 99% do not qualify for those listings. these listings ofter require advanced bachelor semesters or a bachelors degree already and require 6 months per minimum. the gap between abiturabschluss and hochschulvorlesungsstart is 4 months ish and who does not want a few weeks of time off after finishing school right. so they trödel dahin. they still get accepted into the program, but they have to have done the internship before beginning the bachelors thesis, and then on top of that they need to do a 5 week internship. and no company does 5 week internships, it has to be longer. so they wither join a student club that counts the hours worked there as hours worked inthe internship, or they take a semester off to focus on the internships, which is not ideal either. some even do their internship during the 4 week gap between last exam and beginning of the classes, and then 4 weeks again. into the vorlesungszeit. why am i telling you this. well, i have been working ona website, the internship platform thing. Internship Review Platform – What It Is This platform lets students easily share and explore internship experiences. It’s built to be fast, intuitive, and respectful of your privacy. Users can leave structured reviews by answering a few key questions and writing a short reflection. Reviews are then displayed in a clean, visual layout, giving others a quick but meaningful overview. An overall rating helps compare internships at a glance, while deeper details are available for those who want to read more. Users can also manage their own reviews and interact with others'. It’s privacy-conscious, user-friendly, and designed to make sharing insights about internships both useful and effortless. the goal is also to write to the companies that offered these internships, and to other companies that have been kept untouched, to make another function which is the internship posting colum. i write them, they give me a text, bring it into the list of stellenanzeigen, and the kunden can see internships done, and their evaluatinos, and stellenanzeigen. the stellenanzeigen is to find places that guaranteededly want interns, and it boosts long term stickyness. "maybe there is a new interesging listing. i will check the platform out, maybe there is even something for me. oh and i can also post my own". the goal is to expand to 1) other studiengänge, the aerospace one requires pre internships too. and 2) expand to higher level internships, competing against the platforms offering the advanced internships. because people in higher semesters who found their pre internship with that platform might also think about it and look for adequate higher level internships on that platform too. the "industriepraktikum". So the website will help students find places, but also find good places. Distribution: i will have my friends post their internship reviews. Then i will write the companies they did their internship in to post their job postings. in parallel, i will go to the fachschaft maschinenbau and aerospace to promote it during the erstiwoche for example. i will also write a message into the group chat of my maschbau jahrgang. this will bring in more reviews, which will give me leverage to be more convincing when i write even more companies for their job listing. So what will grow organically is the internship reviews, while the job listings will be added manually. thtas the idea. the design philosophy is that of hackernews. so text first, minimal, fast, and no bullshit use only what is necessary. no frameworks unless it is absolutely necessary. I also want to reach out to unternehmertum to find ways on how to monetize this project. maybe found a startup. but then, it is unlikely that the fachschaften will promote the project. its werbung then and not a open source project a student did selflessly. i still dont know how i will go here. And finally, if it goes well, expand to other universities such as the lmu, and tu stuttgart. stuttgart has the raumfahrttechnik program that also requires a pre internship, but a pre internship is not really required in most of the other programmes in germany. So my question. 

there is no product built around “eight‑week, pre‑study workshop internships” with verified, structured reviews. The pain is real and current platforms don’t solve it.

About the market. Is it big enough to matter? Tum maschinenwesen has about 600 newcomers each year, and aerospace has about 500 newcomers each year. Then you have those of TU Stuttgart, RWTH, KIT, FHs. So within Germany, degrees that still require a vorpraktikum adds up to about 15k students. A small but highly concentrated and reproducible every year. 

Each cohort makes the same search annually so we have reliable traffic and word of mouth. That is enough to sustain a specialized platform, but not enough for a classic VC scale exit. Think indie saas / bootstrap or university spin-off rather than the “next LinkedIn”. As much as I wich it to, the idea is simply not GOOD ENOUGH. 


is this really a solution with a good product market fit? is there something i can add. that is missing? some ideas based on what these students need? any advice on my approach here?


the stage. i have the equivalent of maybe 5 hours of work put directly into the programming. so some code on the main page, some links. a login but the server is not working yet. so its really in the very early stage. its important to stick to germany first, as as i learned the pre internship culture is not that prevalent in the rest of europe. yes, i would need suggestinos on specific features, business model ideas and partnership strategies. please take into account the context here. this is tu munich, and i am a second semester bachelor student in Maschinenwesen. I have done 4 weeks in a feinmechanik werkstatt and i did not like it. 4 Weeks, 8 hours a week. And what did I get paid? Nothing.  What would also be interesting is integrating other “look for it yourself” aspects that are often overlooked, such as grants, or stipends for example. Information about exchanges. Things like that. But these examples are probably just the tip of the iceberg. But imagine if students just had one platform to cover most of their “I didnt know about that problem”. Professors pasting their job listings for their hiwi stellen. Hearing about some new competition you haven’t heard of. The robothon for example, or the hackathon. All in one place, under something like events or something. Imagine the transparency we would create. Of course, much will be outsourced by advanced elms, and the students will be able to do queries. So maybe just implement something like a review system for the separate events and competitions and opportunities. Those that actually did that, like me with the innovation sprint by unternehmertum, would review on their experience. Because there will be a point where you learn that just going to places to have a nice resume will not be enough. You need to learn hard, and to go good events, and sprints and workshops. This could fix so much, but I am getting too passionate and a bit hubris here. So I need your comprehensive advice.

So my plan is: 
Start with an ultra lean submission form. Fixed fields: company, website, tags such as paid, and eventually tags such as vorpraktikum/fertigungspraktikum, industriepraktikum. 
Free text: “Three things I learned / Three things that sucked.”  hacker news does not have a sophisticated score system. You can really just upvote, and there is a number representing the “points”. Posts are ranked on relevance, so a combination of how long it is up there and how many points it has. But with internships there really isn’t much of a concern of how far back the internship goes unless it’s like 5 years back.  
Read only list with filters. So you can show the card, and the overall score, based on these upvotes. Which would be expandable for details.   Verification:  one thing that would be optional but differentiating, would be to ask reviewers to upload a redacted Praktikumsbescheinigung. Hash the pdf, dont store the data.   and use a static company which is auto generated each hour or something. Admin backend which can be airtable or notion at first. For me to paste some mini jobs ads collected by mail. 

I want to stick to my hacker news aesthetic. Plain html, html or svelte 

HTML, HTMX or Svelte for sprinkle of interactivity, Supabase for auth, no heavy framework.


So this is not some bloated over engineered multi tier cash grab. This is hacker news style. Use something, and add something new only when you actually need it. Like actually. Keep it extremely simple. Focus on the core value creation. Go hacker news form the style and form the vibe.
